# kubeadm {Multi Node K8s Cluster}


Master node configuration:
=========================
- kube-apiserver
- etcd
- node-controller
- replica-controller

Worker node 1 configuration:
===========================
- kubelet
- container runtime

Worker node 2 configuration:
===========================
- kubelet
- container runtime


Step 1: Install multiple 3 virtual machines and install the openssh-server
Step 2: Install container runtime on the host {install docker on all the nodes}
Step 3: Install kubeadm {kubeadm tools helps us bootstrap the k8s solutions by installing and configuring all the required components in the right nodes}
Step 4: Initialize the master server
Step 5: Create POD network / Cluster network
Step 6: Join the worker nodes to the master

Before you begin
================
- One or more machines running one of:
    Ubuntu 16.04+
    Debian 9+
    CentOS 7
    Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) 7
    Fedora 25+
    HypriotOS v1.0.1+
    Container Linux (tested with 1800.6.0)

- 2 GB or more of RAM per machine (any less will leave little room for your apps)
- 2 CPUs or more
- Full network connectivity between all machines in the cluster (public or private network is fine)
- Unique hostname, MAC address, and product_uuid for every node.
- Certain ports are open on your machines.
- Swap disabled. You MUST disable swap in order for the kubelet to work properly
